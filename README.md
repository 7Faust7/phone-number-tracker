this is a small python project created by tech2etc but remodified and worked upon by me, to be more coherent and much better.


1.to run this please put your phonenumber with the countrycode 
example:
'+288818181818' 
'+622282282281'
2.make an opencage account from https://opencagedata.com/ then get the API key from there
3.have fun running the code.
